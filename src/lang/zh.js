    step1Tit: "1: Connect a wallet",
    step1Txt: "Alice thinks the price of apples will go down over the next six months. Bob thinks apples are cheap and wants to go long. Bob and Alice formalize their trade using an SNS smart contract. Both sides deposit a margin requirement of 10% that will be lost if they misbehave.",
    step2Tit: "2: Trade or invest",
    step2Txt: "Over the next six months the price of apples shifts up and down (but mostly down). As the price shifts down (as verified by SNS’s oracle), Bob automatically contributes money to cover his margin requirement. The more it shifts down the more he contributes.",
    step3Tit: "3: Stake or add liquidity, to claim weekly rewards",
    step3Txt: "After six months, the price of apples has fallen by 30%. Alice's bet was right. Because Bob was consistently contributing funds to re-margin his position and not risk losing his 10% margin requirement, the contract can be instantly settled.",
